# Frontend Mentor - Fylo dark theme landing page

![Design preview for the Fylo dark theme landing page challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links
I deployed this completed challenge on Netlify:
- https://fylo-landingpg.netlify.app/

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-first workflow
- Firefox developer tools


### What I learned
This was a challenging website for me to build and it took me a while but I'm satisfied with the result.
I spefically wanted to get familiar with Bootstrap 5 and his useful components and will definitely use it again in the future because it helped a lot with making everything perfectly responsive and I had to write fewer media queries. 

### What should I focus on in the future to improve my skills (how can I become a better programmer)?
I will use Bootstrap again in my next projects (even if I'm also curious about Tailwind too) so that I can get used to it, and in the meantime I also want to focus on using css preprocessors SASS/LESS.
